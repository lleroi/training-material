To make it easier to find datasets in large histories, you can filter your history by keywords as follows:
  1. Click on the **search datasets (_Rechercher des donn√©es_)** box at the top of the history panel.
     ![history search box]({% link shared/images/history_search_datasets.png %})

  2. Type {% if include.search_term %} **_{{ include.search_term }}_** in this box{% else %}Type a search term in this box (for example a tool name, or sample name){% endif %}

  3. To undo the filtering and show your full history again, press on the *clear search* button {% icon galaxy-clear %} next to the search box
